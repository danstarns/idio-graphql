⚠ `graphql` is a **peerDependency** you may need to install this too.

```
$ npm install graphql
```

## Usage
```javascript
const User = new GraphQLNode({
    name: "User",
    typeDefs: `
        type User {
            id: ID
            name: String
            age: Int
        }

        type Query {
            user(id: ID!): User
        }

## What is a node ?

A [Node](https://danstarns.github.io/idio-graphql/docs/graphql-node) is designed to modularize a [ObjectTypeDefinition](http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#ObjectTypeDefinition) together with its related resolvers & properties. You can think of a node as a module.

```javascript
const User = new GraphQLNode({
    name: "User",
    typeDefs: `
        type User ...

        type Query {
            getUser: User
        }
    `,
    resolvers: {
        Query: {
            getUser: (root, args, ctx) => { ... }
        }
    }
});
```

> You can compose nodes

```javascript
const Comment = new GraphQLNode({
    name: "Comment",
    ...
});

const Post = new GraphQLNode({
    name: "Post",
    nodes: [ Comment ],
    ...
});

const User = new GraphQLNode({
    name: "User",
    nodes: [ Post ]
    ...
});
```

> **Is it all about nodes ?** There are plenty of classes to help you construct your GraphQL schema start reading about schemaAppliances [here](https://danstarns.github.io/idio-graphql/docs/schema-appliances).


## How do I integrate with my Apollo Server ?

The result of `makeExecutableSchema` is returned from `combineNodes` & `GraphQLSchema`.

Using [combineNodes](https://danstarns.github.io/idio-graphql/docs/combine-nodes)

```javascript
const { typeDefs, resolvers } = combineNodes(nodes);

const apolloServer = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });
```
Using [GraphQLGateway](https://danstarns.github.io/idio-graphql/docs/graphql-gateway)

```javascript
const gateway = new GraphQLGateway(
    {
        services: {
            nodes: ["User"]
        }
    },
    {
        transporter: "redis://localhost",
        nodeID: "gateway"
    }
);

const { typeDefs, resolvers } = await gateway.start();

const apolloServer = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });
```


## How do I get started with microservices ?

> Watch tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/LqMpIfib0JU)

This package builds its microservices features on top of a package [Molecular](https://moleculer.services/), this means you can integrate with Moleculer's features. Learn more about using microservices [here](https://danstarns.github.io/idio-graphql/docs/microservices).

> Molecular is a optional dependency 

```javascript
const User = new GraphQLNode({
    name: "User"
});

await User.serve({
    transporter: "nats://localhost"
});
```

> Do not forget to create your [gateway](https://danstarns.github.io/idio-graphql/docs/graphql-gateway)


#### Gradual Adoption
You don't need have to have all your nodes as a service. You can have some nodes hosted on the same instance as the gateway. Use `locals` & `services` in [GraphQLGateway](https://danstarns.github.io/idio-graphql/docs/graphql-gateway) to merge all nodes together. Read more about gradual adoption [here](https://danstarns.github.io/idio-graphql/docs/microservices#gradual-adoption).

## Can I use Schema Directives ?

You can use a [IdioDirective](https://danstarns.github.io/idio-graphql/docs/idio-directive) and apply it at `combineNodes` or `GraphQLGateway`.

```javascript
const MyDirective = new IdioDirective({
    name: "...",
    typeDefs: ` ... `,
    resolver: SchemaDirectiveVisitor
});

const { typeDefs, resolvers, schemaDirectives } = combineNodes(nodes, { directives: [MyDirective] });
```

## How can my nodes talk with each other ?

[Inter-Schema Execution](https://danstarns.github.io/idio-graphql/docs/inter-schema-execution) can be used to make GraphQL powered Queries & Mutations against your own or specified schema.

> Inter-Schema Execution works with your served nodes, this will allow you to accomplish GraphQL powered service-service communication.

```javascript
const Post = new GraphQLNode({
    name: "Post",
    typeDefs: `
        type Post {
            title: String
        }
        
        type Query {
            posts: [Post]
        }
    `,
    resolvers: { ... }
});

const User = new GraphQLNode({
    name: "User",
    typeDefs: `
        type User {
            posts: [Post]
        }
    `,
    resolvers: {
        Fields: {
            posts: async (root, args, { injections }) => {
                const { data, errors } = await injections.execute(
                    `
                        query {
                            posts {
                                title
                            }
                        }
                    `
                );

                return data.posts;
            }
        }
    }
});
```

## Does it support graphql files or graphql tag ?
When specifying `typedefs` You can use; strings, [graphql-tag](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tag) or file paths

## What is the role of the gateway ?
Remember the initial schema & keep track of services with the corresponding names. Produce a Graphql schema after introspecting each supplied service.

> `GraphQLGateway` acts as a reverse proxy when using Inter-Schema execution.

Your gateway will;
1. Not throw if it loses connection to a service
2. Allow unlimited services, with the same name, to join the swarm
3. Load balance requests to each service
4. Not start until all services are connected
5. Ensure no other gateway has the same name but different schema

> You can spawn multiple instances of the same gateway 

## Does it support subscriptions ?
You can setup subscriptions in a [node](https://danstarns.github.io/idio-graphql/docs/graphql-node). Subscriptions will work with microservices.

```javascript
const User = new GraphQLNode({
    name: "User",
    typeDefs: `
        type User ...

        type Subscription {
            userUpdate: User
        }
    `,
    resolvers: {
        Subscription: {
            userUpdate: {
                subscribe: async function* (){} // AsyncGenerator
            }
        }
    }
});
```

> Subscriptions will not work service-service communication.

# Quick Start
```
$ npm install idio-graphql apollo-server graphql-tag
```

```javascript
const {
    combineNodes,
    GraphQLNode
} = require("idio-graphql");

const { ApolloServer } = require("apollo-server");
const gql = require("graphql-tag");

const User = new GraphQLNode({
    name: "User",
    typeDefs: gql`
        type User {
            id: ID
            name: String
            age: Int
        }

        type Query {
            user(id: ID!): User
        }
    `,
    resolvers: {
        Query: {
            user: (parent, { id }) => { ... }
        }
    }
});

async function main() {
    const { typeDefs, resolvers } = combineNodes([ User ]);

    const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });

    await server.listen(4000);

    console.log(`http://localhost:4000/graphql`);
}

main();
```
# Microservices Quick Start

> Requires [nats-server](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-server) @ nats://localhost:4222

```
$ npm install idio-graphql apollo-server graphql-tag moleculer nats
```

## User Service

```javascript
const gql = require("graphql-tag");
const { GraphQLNode } = require("idio-graphql");

const User = new GraphQLNode({
    name: "User",
    typeDefs: gql`
        type User {
            id: String
            name: String
            age: Int
        }

        type Query {
            user(id: String!): User
        }
    `,
    resolvers: {
        Query: {
            user: (root, { id }) => { ... }
        }
    }
});

await User.serve({
    gateway: "gateway",
    transporter: "NATS"
});
```

## Gateway Service

```javascript
const { ApolloServer } = require("apollo-server");
const { GraphQLGateway } = require("idio-graphql");

const gateway = new GraphQLGateway(
    { services: { nodes: ["User"] } },
    {
        transporter: "NATS",
        nodeID: "gateway"
    }
);

const { typeDefs, resolvers } = await gateway.start();

const server = new ApolloServer({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers
});

await server.listen(4000);
```
